# Ex.No:3(A)  STRING AND ITS OPERATIONS IN JAVA
## AIM:
To write a Python function that accepts a string and prints the first three and last three characters of that string.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the function with a string parameter.
2. Check if the length of the string is at least 3 characters.
3. Extract the first 3 characters using slicing (string[:3]).
4. Extract the last 3 characters using slicing (string[-3:]).
5. Print the first 3 characters.
6. Print the last 3 characters.
7. End of program.
